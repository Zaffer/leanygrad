/- Step 1: Expanding upon the ShapeTracker definition -/
-- Define the ShapeTracker structure with the fields and validity condition.
structure ShapeTracker where
  old_shape : List Nat
  old_stride : List Nat
  merge_old_shape : List Nat
  valid : old_shape.length = old_stride.length -- This line ensures the lists have the same length

/- Step 2: Expanding upon the mergeability predicate -/

-- Placeholder functions for illustrative purposes only. Replace with actual logic.
def some_complicated_list_condition (list1 list2 : List Nat) : Prop :=
  -- Logic to check if list1 can merge with list2
  true -- Replace 'true' with the actual merge condition.

def some_complicated_stride_condition (stride1 stride2 : List Nat) : Prop :=
  -- Logic to check if stride1 can merge with stride2
  true -- Replace 'true' with the actual merge condition.
-- Define the areMergeable predicate using placeholder functions for sophisticated conditions.
def areMergeable (shape1 shape2 : ShapeTracker) : Prop :=
  -- This function should check the actual rules for mergeability, e.g., adjacent dimensions.
  -- It will require a sophisticated function definition that checks for Case 1 and Case 2.
  -- You will need to define some_complicated_list_condition and some_complicated_stride_condition appropriately.
  let shapes_can_merge : Prop := some_complicated_list_condition shape1.old_shape shape2.merge_old_shape,
      strides_can_merge : Prop := some_complicated_stride_condition shape1.old_stride shape2.old_stride
  in shapes_can_merge ∧ strides_can_merge
  -- Mergeability is satisfied when both conditions are true.

/- Step 3: Creating helper lemmas for non-zero and zero strides mergeability -/
-- These should closely follow the logic given in the reshape_without_symbolic.md

-- Define a lemma for the non-zero strides mergeability condition.
lemma non_zero_strides_mergeable {st1, st2, s1 : Nat}
  h_non_zero_strides : st1 = st2 * s1 ∧ st1 ≠ 0) : Prop :=
  -- Conclusion about their mergeability according to the specified condition
  true -- Placeholder for now

-- Define a lemma for the zero strides mergeability condition.
lemma zero_strides_mergeable {st1 st2 : Nat}
  h_zero_strides : st1 = 0 ∨ st2 = 0 :
  -- Conclusion about their mergeability according to the specified condition
  true -- Placeholder for now

-- Step 4: Prove that two given ShapeTrackers are mergeable
theorem shapeTracker_mergeable_theorem {shape1 shape2 : ShapeTracker} (h : areMergeable shape1 shape2) :
  -- Mergeability conclusion based on areMergeable predicate
  true := by
  -- Here we would spell out the proof using the lemmas and functions defined above
  sorry -- As before, 'sorry' will be replaced by an actual proof

-- As noted earlier, this is a high-level view of the components needed for your proof.
-- You’ll need to fill in the details for the predicates `areMergeable`, `non_zero_strides_mergeable`, and `zero_strides_mergeable`.
-- These will include the specific logic based on the mergeability conditions described in the document.
