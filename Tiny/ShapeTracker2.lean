-- Step 1: Expanding upon the ShapeTracker definition
structure ShapeTracker where
  old_shape : List ℕ
  old_stride : List ℕ
  merge_old_shape : List ℕ
  valid : old_shape.length = old_stride.length -- This line ensures the lists have the same length

-- Step 2: Expanding upon the mergeability predicate
def areMergeable (shape1 shape2 : ShapeTracker) : Prop :=
  -- This function should check the actual rules for mergeability, e.g., adjacent dimensions.
  -- It will require a sophisticated function definition that checks for Case 1 and Case 2.
  let shapes_can_merge := some_complicated_list_condition shape1.old_shape shape2.merge_old_shape;
  let strides_can_merge := some_complicated_stride_condition shape1.old_stride shape2.old_stride;
  -- Both shape and stride conditions must be satisfied for mergeability.
  shapes_can_merge ∧ strides_can_merge

-- Step 3: Creating helper lemmas for non-zero and zero strides mergeability
-- These should closely follow the logic given in the reshape_without_symbolic.md

-- Drawing from the criteria specified, here are simplified examples:
lemma non_zero_strides_mergeable {st1 st2 s1 : ℕ} (h_non_zero_strides : st1 = st2 * s1 ∧ st1 ≠ 0) :
  -- Conclusion about their mergeability according to the specified condition
  true -- Placeholder for now

lemma zero_strides_mergeable {st1 st2 : ℕ} (h_zero_strides : st1 = 0 ∨ st2 = 0) :
  -- Conclusion about their mergeability according to the specified condition
  true -- Placeholder for now

-- Step 4: Prove that two given ShapeTrackers are mergeable
theorem shapeTracker_mergeable_theorem {shape1 shape2 : ShapeTracker} (h : areMergeable shape1 shape2) :
  -- Mergeability conclusion based on areMergeable predicate
  true := by
  -- Here we would spell out the proof using the lemmas and functions defined above
  sorry -- As before, 'sorry' will be replaced by an actual proof

-- As noted earlier, this is a high-level view of the components needed for your proof.
-- You’ll need to fill in the details for the predicates `areMergeable`, `non_zero_strides_mergeable`, and `zero_strides_mergeable`.
-- These will include the specific logic based on the mergeability conditions described in the document.
