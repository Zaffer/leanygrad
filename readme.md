To begin the proof in Lean, we must first formalize the problem space. The document you provided outlines the issue of reshaping tensors within a machine learning library without using symbolic operations. Specifically, it discusses conditions for merging tensor dimensions (shapes) and how to handle masks during this process.

The primary goal is to determine, under what conditions two arbitrary ShapeTrackers can be merged. Here we need to distill the conditions for merging provided in the document into logical statements that can be formalized in Lean's type theory.

Here is an initial strategy to tackle the problem:

Define the types: We need to represent tensor shapes, strides, and masks as types in Lean. These might be lists, tuples, or custom datatypes depending on their properties.

Specify the operations: We must define what it means to merge tensor shapes and manipulate masks. This will likely involve writing functions that represent the reshaping and merging process.

Formalize the assumptions and claims: Take the textual assumptions and claims from the document and formulate them as predicates or lemmas in Lean.

Prove the conclusions: Use the assumptions and core Lean libraries to establish the proof for the claims. This often involves applying induction, case analysis

, contradiction, and constructive proofs.

Our step-by-step guide will be as follows:

Step 1: Types Representation

Shape could be a list of integers.
Stride could be a list of integers.
Mask could be a list with ranges or perhaps a function from indices to ranges.
For example:

def Shape := list ℕ
def Stride := list ℕ
def Mask := list (ℕ × ℕ) -- Assuming mask is a list of ranges (start, end)
Step 2: Define Operations The document outlines two key operations: merging shapes and reshaping masks. These operations will be functions in Lean.

For example:

```lean
def merge_shapes (s1 s2 : Shape) : Option Shape
def reshape_mask (old_mask : Mask) (new_shape : Shape) : Option Mask
```

We would use Option type to represent the potential failure of these operations when the conditions are not met.

Step 3: Formalize Assumptions and Claims We turn English descriptions of merge conditions into predicates. For example, for the claim that two parts of a shape p₁ and p₂ are mergeable:

```lean
def are_mergeable (p₁ p₂ : Shape) : Prop := ...
```
Step 4: Prove Conclusions We would use Lean's proof environment to construct proofs for the given claims. Depending on the claims, we might employ tactics like induction, apply, and exact.

For the given claim that if prod([k₁ ... kp]) < p₁ and prod([k₁ ... kₚ₊₁]) > p₁, the reshape is not possible, we might do:

```lean
lemma reshape_not_possible (p₁ : Shape) (ks : Shape) (p : ℕ) : prod(take p ks) < p₁ → prod(take (p + 1) ks) > p₁ → ¬reshapable ks p₁ :=
...
```

We'll start by fleshing out Step 1 and defining our basic types. Once the types are set up, we can proceed to define the operations and construct proofs based on the assumptions outlined in the provided document.

Please provide any specific details or structures you’d like to see in the types and operations, if they are different from the proposed examples. Once we have the types represented in Lean, we will need to iterate on defining functions and eventually constructing proofs for the conditions outlined.
